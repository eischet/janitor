# Sample Program Collection

This is a collection of sample programs designed to be (possibly) uploaded to https://sampleprograms.io, a fun project comparing different programming languages.

See [SampleProgramsIOTestCase.java](../../janitor-lang/src/test/java/com/eischet/janitor/SampleProgramsIOTestCase.java) for a unit test that runs the
finished scripts and checks their output.
