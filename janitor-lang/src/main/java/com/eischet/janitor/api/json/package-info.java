/**
 * This package contains classes for JSON serialization and deserialization.
 *
 * <p></p>
 *
 * <p>The API is very similar to Google's GSON, which is used in the original implementation. You could call this
 * a GSON wrapper, if you'd like. It's possible, if required, to swap out the GSON implementation for another when
 * desired, and that would be harder when working with GSON directly.</p>
