# Textmate Bundle for Janitor

Basic Syntax highlighting for Janitor.

This has been tested with IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.0.1.

The grammar is based on the vscode grammar, with the "include" directives removed while trying to 
get it to work in TextMate. I haven't gotten it to work in the actual TextMate app 2.0.23, and 
haven't really tried hard either, though.
