# Janitor 

Janitor is an embedded scripting and expression language for (Java) applications.

```
for (i in [1,2,3]) {
    print("Did you stick a penny in there?");
}
```

## Main Goals

* Be accessible to programming novices and casual developers by providing simple and familiar syntax.
* Be easy to embed into existing code by application developers.
* Be reasonably safe by "sandboxing" everything by default: Developers must explicitly allow access where desired.
* Be free (MIT License).
